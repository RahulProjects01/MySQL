1.
List the teachers who have NULL for their department.

 --> select name from teacher where dept is null

2.
Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.
--> SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
 FROM teacher INNER JOIN dept
           ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

3.
Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.

-->select teacher.name,dept.name from teacher left join dept on (teacher.dept = dept.id)

4.
Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.

-->  select teacher.name,dept.name from teacher right join dept on (teacher.dept = dept.id) 

5.
Use COALESCE to print the mobile number. Use the number '07986 444 2266' if there is no number given. Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266'

-->  select name, COALESCE(mobile,'07986 444 2266') AS aff from teacher 

6.
Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.

-->select teacher.name, COALESCE(dept.name,'None') from teacher left join dept on (teacher.dept = dept.id)

Using the COALESCE function

5.

7.
Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.
-->  
select count(name),count(mobile) from teacher


8.
Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff. Use a RIGHT JOIN to ensure that the Engineering department is listed.

-->
select dept.name, count(teacher.dept) from teacher right join dept on (teacher.dept = dept.id) group by dept.name


9.
Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.
--->
select name , case 
                  when dept = 1 or dept = 2 then 'Sci'
                  else 'Art'
                  end
              from teacher


10.
Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.

-->
select name , 
          CASE 
            when dept = 1 or dept = 2 then 'Sci'
            when dept = 3 then 'Art'
            else 'None'
